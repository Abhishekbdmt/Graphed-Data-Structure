# Graphed-Data-Structure
This program was designed based on the given project specifications. The primary purpose of this project was for the designed program to properly build a custom graph based data structure from a data file. The data file inputted by the user would contain a list of nodes and its adjacent linked nodes. The program was to parse through the data file and create each node and build pointers that connect the nodes together by utilizing a disjoint set design. Each node mapped would also need to prevent overlapping or redundant pointing to other nodes formerly declared. Once the graph structure was fully built the program was also required to support a companion function. This functions goal was to calculate the "degree" of each listed node stored. Essentially to see the number of adjacent nodes is connected to the root node. The program must transverse the graph and then print out a histogram. The purpose of this project was to introduce one of the most common and fundamental data structures in use today. Graphs is perhaps the most vital data structure to many big companies such as Facebook and Google which heavily rely on users going through adjacent or connected forms of information.
